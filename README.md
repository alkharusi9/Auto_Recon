# Auto_Recon
This is a bash script that could be used for automating the reconnaissance process.It has bunch of commands that will help you do the following:
  1) Find details about any open ports using nmap.
  2) Find hidden directories using gobuster 
  3) Find more details about the target and any possible exploits using nikto
  4) Find subdomains using Sublist3r.
### Usage:  ./auto_recon.sh <target> 
### This is just a startup and the script still has too many issues and needs some improvements, so I am still working on it and will keep improving it. 
## Discalimer: This script should be used for educational puposes only.
